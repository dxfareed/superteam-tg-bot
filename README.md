## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

## üê≥ Deployment

This bot is optimized for deployment as a container, particularly on **Google Cloud Run**.

### Docker

A `Dockerfile` is included for easy containerization.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t superteam-tg-bot .
    ```

2.  **Run the container locally:**
    You'll need to pass your environment variables to the container.
    ```bash
    docker run --env-file .env superteam-tg-bot
    ```

### Google Cloud Run

1.  **Build and push the image to Google Container Registry (GCR):**
    ```bash
    gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID/superteam-tg-bot
    ```
2.  **Deploy to Cloud Run:**
    Deploy the container image, making sure to set the environment variables from your `.env` file in the Cloud Run service configuration.
    ```bash
    gcloud run deploy superteam-tg-bot \
      --image gcr.io/YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID/superteam-tg-bot \
      --platform managed \
      --region YOUR_REGION \
      --allow-unauthenticated \
      --set-env-vars "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token,FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id,..."
    ```

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

This bot is architected to be extremely cost-effective by leveraging the generous free tiers of Google Cloud services.

-   **Hosting (Google Cloud Run):** The free tier includes 2 million requests per month, which is more than sufficient for a typical community bot.
-   **Database (Firebase Firestore):** The free tier includes 1 GiB of storage and substantial daily read/write quotas, easily covering the bot's needs.
-   **AI (Google Gemini API):** The API calls for the `/faq` command fall within a free tier suitable for moderate usage.

For most communities, the estimated monthly cost to run this bot is **$0**.

You would only incur costs if the bot experiences exceptionally high traffic (e.g., many thousands of active users and constant API calls), and even then, the costs would be minimal, likely starting at **$1-5 per month**.
