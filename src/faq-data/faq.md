What is Colosseum?
 SColosseum is the world's largest online hackathons, where elite crypto founders launch startups on Solana.Select hackathon winners raise $250,000 from Colosseum's venture fund, gain access to an exclusive founder network, and join Colosseum's accelerator to build unstoppable momentum.

What is Colosseum's Accelerator?
Our accelerator program is optimized to help founders get embedded deeply in the Solana ecosystem, and to reach breakout velocity with their startups:

Colosseum at its core is an exclusive founder community. Accelerator founders will get access to a group of the most elite founders in the Solana ecosystem. This community includes previous hackathon winners, leadership from Solana Labs and Foundation, and founders from the top startups in crypto. This group of peers are an invaluable resource as you progress through your startup journey.

Colosseum will help you get to market as quickly as possible, whether through key ecosystem partnerships, developer support, or tried and true growth strategies.

Colosseum provides a comprehensive educational series that covers how to find product-market fit, market your product, establish the economics of your business, and much more.

And most importantly, Colosseum will prepare you to raise a seed round of capital. In addition to the upfront funding you will receive directly from Colosseum, we will help you in refining your pitch, make intros to the top investors in crypto, and host an investor Demo Day that is the culmination of the program.

How long is the Accelerator?
The program runs for eight weeks, with the second and third being IRL in San Francisco. While the accelerator concludes with Colosseum's Demo Day, support from our team and founder community will continue throughout the life of your startup. The discussion boards, content, and tools on our platform will be available to you forever.

How is Colosseum's Accelerator structured?
The program includes 1:1 mentorship with the Colosseum team, access to an elite founder community, connections with top developers and VCs in the ecosystem, weekly educational sessions, and an investor Demo Day.

1:1 Mentorship: Colosseum will split up the startups in the batch between our 3 cofounders: Matty, Clay, and Nate. We will be oncall for the teams we are assigned throughout the program, to support and coach on everything from GTM strategy to VC pitches to making intros to anyone who can help accelerate your startup.

Founder Community: Accelerator founders will immediately get access to a private group of current Solana founders and developers. Most of your peers in this group have won previous Solana Hackathons and have gone on to grow their startups to be in the upper echelon of the crypto ecosystem. This group of connections is the best way to become embedded in the Solana ecosystem. See who is already in the group.

Educational Sessions: Each week, leading crypto founders and developers host a comprehensive set of educational sessions to help your startup grow. These mentor group sessions are optional. However, accelerator founders are required to attend weekly group check ins. To accommodate all time zones, the sessions and office hours will usually start at 10am EST.

Demo Day: During the last week of the program, Colosseum will invite 150+ early-stage crypto investors to a private Demo Day where founders have the opportunity to pitch their startups. Each team will have 2 minutes to pitch.

What is Colosseum's Dropout Program for university students?
Our Dropout Program provides ambitious students the opportunity to build full-time on their crypto startup. Admitted students will be automatically accepted into Colosseum's next accelerator cohort and receive an upfront investment of $250,000 in their startup. To be eligible for the prize, students are required to:

Win one of the university prizes in our hackathon

Be willing to drop out or take a leave of absence from their university to commit full-time to their startup

Be under the age of 23 and currently attend a 4-year college

Be interviewed by the Colosseum team to determine eligibility

What is Colosseum's relationship with the Solana Foundation?
The Solana Foundation is an LP in Colosseum's venture fund. Colosseum also works with the Foundation to administer and promote their official hackathon.

How many Accelerator batches are there per year?
Colosseum runs two hackathons per year. After each, Colosseum will accept a new Accelerator batch sourced from hackathon winners and Eternal applicants.

It's a marketplace for Web3 talent to earn income through various work formats, leveraging Solana's fast and low-cost transactions.

What are Bounties?
A bounty is a competitive task, where everyone participating does the work and the best submission(s) get rewarded. Consider it as a contest where multiple people attempt the same scope of work.
Bounties are a great way to build your crypto proof of work while having an upside of winning some $$ for excellent work.

The main difference between bounty and project listings is the number of people who complete the scope of work. Multiple people submit in a bounty, while for a Project, only the selected person/team completes the scope of work. 

Who can participate on Superteam Earn?
Anyone with an email address and a Solana wallet! 

What is the payout process for the winners?
All sponsors have their own payout processes. Usually, once the winners are announced, the sponsor will pay out the winners on their own without contacting them, using the wallet address mentioned by the winners on their profile. 
Others might reach out to the winners for confirmation of their wallet addresses before paying out.
